#About this project

This project was created purely for fun and to improve my design skills, so it does not have a backend. Additionally, I chose to avoid most dependencies, such as Redux, to make solving problems and developing my logical skills more challenging.

Although it isn't a real book, all the content within it is original. The map and characters (excluding their images) are registered, so you cannot use them unless it is for educational purposes.

The images of the characters and writers were generated by an AI, so you are free to use them as they are in the public domain.

Its a react proyect, so you can run it via npm install - npm start.

Thank you for reading!
